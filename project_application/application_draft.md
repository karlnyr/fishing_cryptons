This is transposable elements, they are pretty cool. They can do this and this. There is science on that they can be domesticated in hosts, contributing to the genetic evolution of the species. They are devided into classes and one of the less understood classes is called cryptons. This is du to the fact that they are less classified and also lack some of the identifiers used in regular TE recognition. Due to the lack of previous genetic data. However, now the data accessible on these species are developed as well as a larger and more diverse repository of TE's, found in places such as repbase. We intend here to engage these cryptons with the usage of the now further developed databases and see what we find. It is going to be a fishing expedition were we wont know what exactly will find., but we will start by trying to find the cryptons in different hosts, starting with closesly related ones and diversifying to further separated species if the search comes out short. We inted to use the available sequences from NCBI and in-house sequences if necessary/available. Softwares that are to be used is going to be tBLASTx, BLAST, Repbase etc etc.
