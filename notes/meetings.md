blastp kirc into genbank, blastp now has taxa. Selection by relevance, if there is already studies of a crypton in a genome we can sole this one out. Take a crypton from each crypton group to start of with. There will probably be a better assembly and more hits of crypton_F sequences, due to better annotation. 

* Make sure now to get acquianted with blastp and maybe the flanking sequence script on the lab site. 
* Get access to rackham
* Find paper or method on searching for unannotated sequences in eukaryotic genomes

Scripts that can extract top hits for alignments. Use shorten scaffold script, not rename, to get the corrected genome. See it to be done with the sequences by tomorrow 17-09-19 16:30. JC on monday (23-09-19) monday 11:00.
