blastp kirc into genbank, blastp now has taxa. Selection by relevance, if there is already studies of a crypton in a genome we can sole this one out. Take a crypton from each crypton group to start of with. There will probably be a better assembly and more hits of crypton_F sequences, due to better annotation. 

* Make sure now to get acquianted with blastp and maybe the flanking sequence script on the lab site. 
* Get access to rackham
* Find paper or method on searching for unannotated sequences in eukaryotic genomes
