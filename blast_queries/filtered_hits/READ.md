filtered_hits contain the filtered output of raw blast fmt6 files. Here we have ACN, MODEL and GENE.

ACN - Accession numbers of blast hits of query sequence. The ACN extracted from raw fmt 6 files are 
marked with a flanking number, designating the minimum hits required for extraction.

MODEL - Protein model blast hits are filtered into separate file for further research or to be kept separate from 
genomic sequences

GENE - Genomic sequences blast hits are kept separate for sequence extraction in later stages in pipeline
